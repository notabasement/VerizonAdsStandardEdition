 API definition for native text components.
 
 This protocol extends the VASNativeViewComponent protocol with readwrite accessors to some aspects of the text and its properties. All access to these properties must be performed on the main thread, as with all UI activity.
 
 Note that the `view` property defined on VASNativeViewComponent is returned as a UILabel in the case of components that conform to this protocol if access to other properties such as textAlignment are required.
