 Protocol for interacting with an ad adapter.
 
 Note that the VASAdAdapter object is instantiated by the VASWaterfallProcessor. It requires that the concrete class implementation has one of these init methods in priority order:
 
 // If a network connection is required, the NSURLSession can be provided to allow for custom network handling such as mock NSURLSession objects for debugging/testing. This will be the NSURLSession object used to instantiate the current VASAds object, or if it was instantiated with nil, will use [NSURLSession sharedSession].
 - (instancetype)initWithSession:(NSURLSession *)session;
 
 // If more properties or functionality from the current VASAds object is needed, it can be provided in your initializer.
 - (instancetype)initWithVASAds:(VASAds *)vasAds;
 
 // The final init if the others are not implemented.
 - (instancetype)init;

 Prepare an instance of an ad adapter. This is executed on an arbitrary background queue and may block for any necessary preparation but must be completed within the limits of the timeout set by the `VASAds.h requestAdsForRequestorClass` specified timeout.
