/**
 VASRequestMetadataBuilder uses the builder pattern to create instances of VASRequestMetadata.
 VASRequestMetadata is immutable once created but the builder can be used to create a copy and make changes.
 The builder can be initialized to be empty, or with an existing VASRequestMetadata instance, or with metadata maps.
 Note that the maps can be set directly and that there are some convenience setters that offer more direct access to some
 well known metadata properties. However, if both are provided (or inherited from the copy) the convenience setters will
 overwrite/replace any entries from the metadata maps when the instance builder method is invoked.
 <br/>
 Note that this builder does not support a "fluent" style interface (no chaining of setters) because they are awkward in
 Objective-C, but it is still useful to use the builder pattern here for several reasons. For example, it is useful when
 making a copy of VASRequestMetadata and only a couple properties need to change. It is also needed to employ the
 special overwrite logic we perform for the convenience setters before an instance is built by the builder.
 <br/>
 This class is not designed to be thread-safe. It is intended to be a lightweight helper for building instances of
 VASRequestMetadata (which is thread-safe and immutable). The normal use case is to use it as a helper and discard it.
 Do not share or reuse instances of VASRequestMetadataBuilder in a way that would cause concurrency problems.

 Builds an immutable instance of VASRequestMetadata using the properties previously set on the builder.

 Convenience setters are tracked internally and then merged into their respective metadata maps and reset
 when an instance is built. This ensures that they always overwrite the main metadata maps.
